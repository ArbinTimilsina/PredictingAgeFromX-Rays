# Predicting Age FromX-Rays

# Goal
Develop an algorithm to determine the age of a child by utilizing pediatric hand radiographs (x-rays of hands). 

# Dataset
The dataset was originally published on [CloudApp](http://rsnachallenges.cloudapp.net/competitions/4) as an RSNA challenge. However, for this project, it was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/rsna-bone-age/data).
